 * "Haunted Restaurant" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users must
 * enter the restaurant either through the bar or the lobby, and make thier way
 * through the restaurant while dodging ghosts. There is a secret exit through
 * the restroom in the back... if the player makes it that far.
 * 
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 * 
 * This Game class creates and initializes all the others: it creates all rooms,
 * creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates and executes the
 * commands that the parser returns.
