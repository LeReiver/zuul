/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This class is part of the "Haunted Restaurant" application.
 * "Haunted Restaurant" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users must
 * enter the restaurant either through the bar or the lobby, and make thier way
 * through the restaurant while dodging ghosts. There is a secret exit through
 * the restroom in the back... if the player makes it that far.
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game. It is connected
 * to other rooms via exits. The exits are labelled north, east, south, west.
 * For each direction, the room stores a reference to the neighboring room, or
 * null if there is no exit in that direction.
