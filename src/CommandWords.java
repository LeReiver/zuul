/**
 * This class is part of the "Haunted Restaurant" application. 
 * "Haunted Restaurant" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
 * must enter the restaurant either through the bar or the lobby, and make 
 * thier way through the restaurant while dodging ghosts. There is a secret
 * exit through the restroom in the back... if the player makes it that far. 
 * 
 * This class holds an enumeration of all command words known to the game.
 * It is used to recognise commands as they are typed in.

 * Modifications:
 * - added "look" and "drink" to String[] validCommands
 * - added showAll() method
 * - changed showAll() method to getCommandList() so it 
 *   returns a String instead of printing the results
